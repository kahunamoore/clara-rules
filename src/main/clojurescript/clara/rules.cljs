   Inserted facts are logical, in that if the support for the insertion is removed, the fact
   will automatically be retracted. For instance, if there is a rule that inserts a \"Cold\" fact
   if a \"Temperature\" fact is below a threshold, and the \"Temperature\" fact that triggered
   the rule is retracted, the \"Cold\" fact the rule inserted is also retracted. This is the underlying
   truth maintenance facillity.

   This truth maintenance is also transitive: if a rule depends on some criteria to fire, and a
   criterion becomes invalid, it may retract facts that invalidate other rules, which in turn
   retract their conclusions. This way we can ensure that information inferred by rules is always

   Retracting facts from the right-hand side has slightly different semantics than insertion. As described
   in the insert! documentation, inserts are logical and will automatically be retracted if the rule
   that inserted them becomes false. This retract! function does not follow the inverse; retracted items
   are simply removed, and not re-added if the rule that retracted them becomes false.

   The reason for this is that retractions remove information from the knowledge base, and doing truth
   maintenance over retractions would require holding onto all retracted items, which would be an issue
   in some use cases. This retract! method is included to help with certain use cases, but unless you
   have a specific need, it is better to simply do inserts on the rule's right-hand side, and let
   Clara's underlying truth maintenance retract inserted items if their support becomes false."
